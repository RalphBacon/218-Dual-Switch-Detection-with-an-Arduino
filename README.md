# 218 - Dual Switch Detection with an Arduino
Detecting commoned switches on the Arduino

Refer to my video #218 https://youtu.be/n4l9TLJuL0Q

I'm triggering the Arduino using a dual MOSFET auto on/off configuration with a single switch.

But I need to add a further switch so how to I enable the Arduino to detect which switch did the triggering?
